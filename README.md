# Network-Science-Facebook-TV-Shows

For this project we will be using the Facebook Pages for TV shows of mutually liked facebook pages. The nodes represent the pages and the edges represented mutual likes amongst them. The data collected in November 2017 with undirected edges. In this section we will be loading the dataset and conducting preliminary checks to handle any discrepancies, such as missing values, duplicates, missing nodes that are present in the edges but do not appear in the nodes dataset.
In the Jupyter Notebook we have included:
1. Network Level Analysis
2. Node Level Analysis
3. Group Level Analysis
4. Recommendation System with Node2Vec
